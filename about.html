							<a href="#">Definition And History of Library</a>
							<p>A library is a curated collection of sources of information and similar resources, selected by experts and made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing. It provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other formats. Libraries range widely in size up to millions of itemsThe first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing—the clay tablets in cuneiform script discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC. Private or personal libraries made up of written books appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the Classical period, the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and Alexandria.A library is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution, a corporation, or a private individual. Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to—or cannot afford to—purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with their research. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are experts at finding and organizing information and at interpreting information needs. Libraries often provide quiet areas for studying, and they also often offer common areas to facilitate group study and collaboration. Libraries often provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources and the Internet.</p>

							<a href="#">Pre Plans</a>
							<p> After building committee has completed its planning it set down in writing, for the guidance of architect, a detailed, explicit statement of the requirements of the library. This statement may be prepared by the librarian by the library consultant, or by the architect in consultation with librarian or by the building committee itself</div>

							<a href="#">Free Plans</a>
							<p> In early stages of planning it is helpful to make some rough estimates of space requirements in terms of floor area. These estimates can be used in calculating probable cost of construction and they can be kept in mind when building sites are being considered</div>
